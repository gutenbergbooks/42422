<h2 class="p4"><i>PREFACE</i></h2>

<p class="blockquote">Oh that my words were now written!<br />
Oh that they were inscribed in a book!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Job</span> xix, 23.</p>

<p>Books have, from time immemorial, been the conservators
of human wisdom, the repositories of information,
the mentors of youth and adolescence,
the counsellors of manhood, the comfort and companionship
of age.</p>

<p>The experience of an individual, school or era, when
committed to book form, becomes the common property
of all succeeding time, and the accumulated
knowledge of the past, transmitted from generation
to generation, through the medium of books, may with
justice be regarded as the most valuable of human
heritages.</p>

<p>But they have not always been unmixed blessings;
they have both led and misled; they have
elucidated, yet have mystified.</p>

<p>They have dissipated the shadows of ignorance
and superstition, but in some instances have confused
and obscured the searchlight of truth. In the
economy of human affairs, books have been factors
of no small importance. They have proved the most
potent expositors of iniquitous systems, and when
properly directed against crying evils have accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
speedy reforms. They have precipitated
wars, incited revolts and seditions in the cause of
progress, yet have intensified prejudice, political, religious
and racial. With silent eloquence, they have
cried out against the wrongs of those who had none
to plead their cause, while in other cases, their influence
has tended to perpetuate existing abuses.
In some instances they have taught men to be content
with servitude, in others have ignited the beacon
fires of liberty. Though they are usually found
enlisted under the banners of justice, yet no cause
has ever been so unworthy, and no institution so unholy,
that books have not been written in their defence.
In verity, they have sown both wheat and
tares.</p>

<p>Books have been written on every conceivable subject,
under all conditions, by all sorts of writers, and
from an endless variety of motives. The recompense
of those who have written them has been
equally various. Some have been apotheosized and
worshipped, others have been the recipients of orders
and decorations of honor at the hands of kings and
potentates, while others have received the ovations of
admiring multitudes. Some have anonymously contributed
their mite toward the enrichment of literature,
others have appeared, from whence we know
not, and after placing their offerings upon the
altars of poesy and art have departed unrewarded
into the shadows of obscurity, leaving as footprints
innumerable quotations which have become proverbial.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Some, as the bards and minnesingers of old who
in mediæval castles ate their bread by the sufferance
of the feudal lords and barons, have in more recent
years been dependent upon the bounty of some munificent,
and usually titled patron, to whom they, as
a matter of policy, dedicated their strains and panegyrics,
consequently wielding mercenary pens. Some
who have presumed to write in a manner displeasing
to those who sat in high places have met with vilification,
exile, imprisonment, decapitation, and have
not been strangers to the pillory. Criticism and
ridicule are the patent rewards of incipient authorship,
while want, neglect and starvation have terminated
the career of more than one name afterwards
great in the world of letters.</p>

<p>Aside from motives common to all who with
reverent steps humbly strive to follow where the
great lights of poesy have led, the author of these
unpretentious pages has been actuated by a desire to
portray, in his correct light, a very frequently misrepresented
character, viz.: the pioneer prospector.
It has long been customary for writers of western
fiction to picture this character as a large-hearted
but rough and untutored individual, expressing himself
in a vernacular consisting of equal parts of
slang, profanity and questionable grammar, possessing
no ambitions above the card table or the
strong waters which cause all men to err who drink
them. An intimate acquaintance with this class,
extending from the years of infancy to middle age,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
convinces the writer that the common description
is manifestly unjust and misleading.</p>

<p>The men who flocked to the early gold excitements,
and who subsequently prospected the western mountain
ranges for their hidden wealth, were the cream
of American and European manhood; men possessed
of more than ordinary endowments of intellect, education
and physique, while their industry, bravery
and hardihood have never been questioned.</p>

<p>Proof of this exists in the names which have lingered
behind them as a matter of record, for it
was the prospector who christened the mountains,
gulches and mining locations of the west. A cursory
perusal of the maps of mineral surveys in any western
mining district, will reveal in abundance such
names as Hector, Ajax, Golden Fleece, Atlas,
Pegasus, etc.; indicating that those who applied
them were, if not college graduates, men not unfamiliar
with the classics. The use of such names
as Cleopatra, Crusader or Magna Charta, by a
prospector unversed in history, would naturally be
unexpected. One without knowledge of literature
would hardly grace his location stakes with such
names as Dante, Hamlet or Mephistopheles, while
one entirely unlettered could not by chance hit
upon such names as Pandora, Medusa or Sesostris.</p>

<p>Of the pioneer prospectors but few remain; many
have fallen asleep, others tiring of the privation and
uncertainty incident to a miner's life, are pursuing
other vocations, while many have become prosperous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
ranch and cattle-men and may now be found in
almost any western valley. A few, a very few in
comparison with the less fortunate majority, acquiring
a competence, removed to other localities,
and in not a few instances, have become conspicuous
figures in the world of business, politics and finance.</p>

<p>In the mountainous districts of the west, you may
still occasionally see a veteran prospector of the old
school, living the life of a hermit in his log cabin,
situated in some picturesque park or gulch, near his,
sometimes valuable but more frequently worthless,
mining locations. There he lives winter and summer,
his only companion a cat or dog; the ambitions of
his youth still unrealized, but at three score and ten,
hopeful and expectant. His bent form, white hair,
and venerable bearing impress you strangely at first,
but it is only when you overcome the reticence peculiar
to those who have long dwelt in solitude, and
engage him in conversation, that his mental status
becomes apparent. To your surprise you discover
that he can converse entertainingly on any subject,
from the Mosaic dispensation, to the latest inventions
in the world of mechanism. You may find him
to be, not only a Shakspearean scholar, but a deep
student of that volume which, whether considered
from a sacred or secular point of view, stands preeminently
forth as the Book of Books. You may
find him able to translate Homer, or Virgil, and
that the masterpieces of literature are as familiar
to him as his own cabin walls. A glimpse at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
interior of his cabin discloses an ample stock of
newspapers and magazines, while books are not
strangers. There is something pathetic about his
loneliness; you leave him with the feeling that society
has been the loser by his voluntary banishment,
and are reminded of Gray's immortal lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Full many a gem of purest ray serene.</div>
<div class="line">The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;</div>
<div class="line">Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</div>
<div class="line">And waste its sweetness on the desert air."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>You speculate upon the story of his life, for you
feel that it has a secret, if not a tragedy, connected
with it, into which you may not probe. You ask
yourself the question, "Has not his life been
wasted?" and if he alone is to be considered, there
is none but an affirmative answer. But his life has
not been barren of results. He has been a contributory
factor in the upbuilding of an empire, for he is
one of the class who laid the foundations of western
prosperity.</p>

<p>These men came west for various reasons, some
actuated by the spirit of adventure, some to acquire
fortunes or to retrieve vanished ones, others possibly
to outlive the stigma of youthful mistakes. In the
lives of many of them are sealed chapters. It is with
such that these pages have to do.</p>

<h3>I. THE STORM</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Reflecting, in their crystal snows,</div>
<div class="line">The glittering jewels of the night,</div>
<div class="line">The mountains lay in calm repose</div>
<div class="line">Slumbering 'neath their robes of white.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The stars grew dim,&mdash;a film instead,</div>
<div class="line">The twinkling heavens overspread,</div>
<div class="line">Through which their eyes essayed to peer,</div>
<div class="line">Each moment less distinct and clear,</div>
<div class="line">Till, when the stellar beacons failed,</div>
<div class="line">A darkness unrelieved, prevailed.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Out of the ambient depths of gloom,</div>
<div class="line">Bereft of its accustomed bloom,</div>
<div class="line">Came day-break, comfortless and gray.</div>
<div class="line">Sped the nocturnal shades away,</div>
<div class="line">Unveiling, with their winged retreat,</div>
<div class="line">A twilight sad and incomplete.</div>
<div class="line">Reluctantly, as dawn aspired,</div>
<div class="line">The shadows lingered, then retired</div>
<div class="line">As vanquished armies often yield</div>
<div class="line">Upon a well-contested field,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></div>
<div class="line">And sullenly retrace their course</div>
<div class="line">Before an overwhelming force.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Within the east no purple light</div>
<div class="line">Proclaimed the passing of the night;</div>
<div class="line">No crimson blush appeared to warn</div>
<div class="line">The landscape of returning morn.</div>
<div class="line">Discarding all the gorgeous dyes,</div>
<div class="line">Wherewith the sunset tints the skies,</div>
<div class="line">And mingling with the azure blue,</div>
<div class="line">The warp and woof of sober hue;</div>
<div class="line">The fairies of the air, I wist,</div>
<div class="line">Had spun a silvery web of mist,</div>
<div class="line">Whose texture, ominous and gray,</div>
<div class="line">Obscured the glories of the day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Such was the dreary winter's day,</div>
<div class="line">Which dawned with dull and leaden sky;</div>
<div class="line">No cheerful penetrating ray</div>
<div class="line">Flashed from the sun's resplendent eye.</div>
<div class="line">In vain, through rift and orifice,</div>
<div class="line">He strove with radiant beam to kiss</div>
<div class="line">Each mountain peak and dizzy height,</div>
<div class="line">Apparelled in their garbs of white,</div>
<div class="line">And crown each brow, so bleak and cold,</div>
<div class="line">With burnished diadem of gold.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Ascending in aërial flight,</div>
<div class="line">The wheel of fire did not appear,</div>
<div class="line">To dissipate the fogs of night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></div>
<div class="line">And clarify the atmosphere.</div>
<div class="line">Seeking with fervent ray and fierce,</div>
<div class="line">The canopy of cloud to pierce,</div>
<div class="line">The orb of day, stripped of his flame,</div>
<div class="line">A circle, ill-defined, became,</div>
<div class="line">As through the ever-thickening haze,</div>
<div class="line">His feeble outline met the gaze.</div>
<div class="line">This faded till his glowing face</div>
<div class="line">Left no suggestive spot or trace,</div>
<div class="line">No corollary on the pall</div>
<div class="line">Which settled and pervaded all.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">As stormy cowls their summits hid,</div>
<div class="line">In turret, tower and pyramid,</div>
<div class="line">Of stately and majestic mien,</div>
<div class="line">Was nature's architecture seen.</div>
<div class="line">From yawning chasm and abyss,</div>
<div class="line">Rose minaret and precipice,</div>
<div class="line">Carved by the tireless hand of time,</div>
<div class="line">In forms fantastic, yet sublime,</div>
<div class="line">While spires impregnable and high,</div>
<div class="line">Were profiled on the lowering sky.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Exceeding the tremendous height</div>
<div class="line">Of brother peaks, on left and right,</div>
<div class="line">In his commanding station placed,</div>
<div class="line">The giant of the rocky waste</div>
<div class="line">With awe-inspiring aspect stood,</div>
<div class="line">The sentry of the solitude,</div>
<div class="line">Guarding the mountainous expanse</div>
<div class="line">With his imposing battlements.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></div>
<div class="line">In rock-ribbed armor panoplied,</div>
<div class="line">With rugged walls on every side,</div>
<div class="line">Beseamed with countless scars and rents,</div>
<div class="line">From combat with the elements,</div>
<div class="line">He towered with mute and massive form,</div>
<div class="line">A challenge to the gathering storm.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">This overshadowing mountain peak</div>
<div class="line">In solemn silence seemed to speak</div>
<div class="line">A prophecy of arctic doom;</div>
<div class="line">As in his frigid splendor dressed,</div>
<div class="line">He reared aloft his frozen crest,</div>
<div class="line">Surmounted by a snowy plume.</div>
<div class="line">His wrinkled and forbidding brow</div>
<div class="line">A sombre shadow seemed to throw</div>
<div class="line">O'er other crags as wild and stern,</div>
<div class="line">Which frowned defiance in return.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The wind, lugubrious and sad,</div>
<div class="line">In doleful accents, soft and low,</div>
<div class="line">Mourned through the dismal forests, clad</div>
<div class="line">In weird habiliments of snow,</div>
<div class="line">As if, forsooth, the sylvan ghosts</div>
<div class="line">Had mobilized in pallid hosts,</div>
<div class="line">To haunt their rugged solitudes,</div>
<div class="line">The spectres of departed woods.</div>
<div class="line">And with uninterrupted flow</div>
<div class="line">The streamlet, underneath the snow,</div>
<div class="line">Answered the wind's despondent moan</div>
<div class="line">With plaint of gurgling monotone;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></div>
<div class="line">Or, locked in winter's stern embrace,</div>
<div class="line">No longer trickled in its bed,</div>
<div class="line">But found a frigid resting place</div>
<div class="line">In stationary ice, instead.</div>
<div class="line">The crystal snowflakes gently fell,</div>
<div class="line">Enrobing mountain, plain and dell,</div>
<div class="line">In mantle spotless and complete,</div>
<div class="line">As nature in her winding sheet.</div>
<div class="line">Layer upon layer fell fast and deep</div>
<div class="line">Till every cliff, abrupt and steep,</div>
<div class="line">Was crowned with coronal of white.</div>
<div class="line">Capricious gusts, which whirl and sift,</div>
<div class="line">Built comb and overhanging drift,</div>
<div class="line">From feathery flakes so soft and light.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">More thickly flew the snow and fast;</div>
<div class="line">The wind developed and the blast</div>
<div class="line">Soon churned the tempest, till the air</div>
<div class="line">Seemed but a white and whirling glare,</div>
<div class="line">Through which the penetrating eye</div>
<div class="line">No shape nor contour might descry.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The poor belated traveller,</div>
<div class="line">Who braved the rigor of that day,</div>
<div class="line">Might thank his bright protecting star,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">If orbs of pure celestial ray,</div>
<div class="line">Far in the scintillating skies,</div>
<div class="line">Preside o'er human destinies,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">That he, bewildered and distressed,</div>
<div class="line">Had warded off exhaustion's rest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></div>
<div class="line">And in that maze of pine and fir</div>
<div class="line">Escaped an icy sepulchre.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">When driving snows accumulate,</div>
<div class="line">They yield to the tremendous weight.</div>
<div class="line">And down the mountain's rugged sides</div>
<div class="line">The mass with great momentum slides,</div>
<div class="line">Cleaving the fragile spruce and pine,</div>
<div class="line">Which stand in its ill-fated line,</div>
<div class="line">As bearded grain, mature and lithe,</div>
<div class="line">Goes down before the reaper's scythe.</div>
<div class="line">Or, when the cyclone's baleful force,</div>
<div class="line">In flood of atmospheric wrath,</div>
<div class="line">Pursues its devastating course,</div>
<div class="line">Leaving but ruin in its path;</div>
<div class="line">Despoiling in a moment's span</div>
<div class="line">The most exalted works of man;</div>
<div class="line">Or waters, suddenly set free,</div>
<div class="line">When some black thunder cloud is rent,</div>
<div class="line">Rush down a wild declivity</div>
<div class="line">With irresistible descent,</div>
<div class="line">Depositing on every hand</div>
<div class="line">A layer of sediment and sand;</div>
<div class="line">With swift and spoliating flow,</div>
<div class="line">Uprooting many a noble tree,</div>
<div class="line">To strew the desert wastes below</div>
<div class="line">With scattered drift-wood and debris;</div>
<div class="line">Such is the dreadful avalanche,</div>
<div class="line">Which rends the forest, root and branch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">From dangers in such varied form,</div>
<div class="line">And the discomforts of the storm,</div>
<div class="line">Small wonder 'twas the mountaineer</div>
<div class="line">Left not his fireside's ruddy cheer;</div>
<div class="line">But from behind the bolted door</div>
<div class="line">Discerned the tempest's strident roar,</div>
<div class="line">Or heard the pendent icicle,</div>
<div class="line">Which, from the eaves, in fragments fell,</div>
<div class="line">As some more formidable blast</div>
<div class="line">In paroxysmal fury passed.</div>
<div class="line">It shook with intermittent throes,</div>
<div class="line">Of boisterous, spasmodic power,</div>
<div class="line">A most substantial hut, which rose,</div>
<div class="line">As summer breeze sways grass or flower</div>
<div class="line">And e'en the dull immobile ground</div>
<div class="line">Trembled in sympathy profound.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Such was the fury of the storm,</div>
<div class="line">As if the crystal flakes had met</div>
<div class="line">With militating hosts, to swarm</div>
<div class="line">In siege about its parapet.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">When every rampant onslaught failed,</div>
<div class="line">The blast in wanton frenzy wailed.</div>
<div class="line">As if with unspent rage the wind</div>
<div class="line">Felt much disgruntled and chagrined,</div>
<div class="line">And though of nugatory force,</div>
<div class="line">Could vent its spleen with accents hoarse.</div>
<div class="line">As some beleaguered tower of old</div>
<div class="line">Besieged by warriors stern and bold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></div>
<div class="line">Who dashed against its walls of stone,</div>
<div class="line">Which were not swayed nor overthrown;</div>
<div class="line">As vicious strokes delivered well,</div>
<div class="line">Innocuous and futile fell.</div>
<div class="line">Then watched the walls withstand the strain,</div>
<div class="line">And cursed and gnashed their teeth in vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Beneath a massive pinnacle,</div>
<div class="line">Whose weird, forbidding shadows fell,</div>
<div class="line">And gulch and forest overcast</div>
<div class="line">With mantle ominous and vast,</div>
<div class="line">Nestling amid the spruce and pine,</div>
<div class="line">Which fringe the edge of timberline,</div>
<div class="line">This miner's cabin, quaint and rude,</div>
<div class="line">From the surrounding forest hewed,</div>
<div class="line">With primitive, yet stable form,</div>
<div class="line">Withstood the onslaught of the storm,</div>
<div class="line">And at the entrance of a dell</div>
<div class="line">Stood as a rustic sentinel.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Beneath a pine's protecting skirt,</div>
<div class="line">It reared its modest roof of poles,</div>
<div class="line">Laid close, then overlaid with dirt,</div>
<div class="line">To cover up the cracks and holes;</div>
<div class="line">The intervals between the logs</div>
<div class="line">Were daubed with mud from mountain bogs.</div>
<div class="line">The ground did service as a floor</div>
<div class="line">In this, as many huts before;</div>
<div class="line">So beaten down beneath the tread,</div>
<div class="line">It more resembled tile instead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The plastic clay, compressed and sleek,</div>
<div class="line">Was level and as hard as brick.</div>
<div class="line">Protruding boulders, smooth and bare,</div>
<div class="line">Exposed their faces here and there;</div>
<div class="line">And with their surfaces displayed,</div>
<div class="line">A primitive mosaic made.</div>
<div class="line">And, terminating in a stack,</div>
<div class="line">Some feet above the cabin's roof,</div>
<div class="line">The fireplace, comfortless and black,</div>
<div class="line">Arose the dingy form uncouth.</div>
<div class="line">This object of depressing gloom,</div>
<div class="line">Built in the corner of the room,</div>
<div class="line">When filled with lurid tongues of flame,</div>
<div class="line">A cheerful cynosure became.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The furnishings within were crude;</div>
<div class="line">A table fastened to the wall</div>
<div class="line">Had been with some exertion hewed</div>
<div class="line">From aspen timbers straight and tall,</div>
<div class="line">And was, in lieu of table legs,</div>
<div class="line">Supported by protruding pegs.</div>
<div class="line">A cracker box, with shelves inside,</div>
<div class="line">The leading corner occupied,</div>
<div class="line">And made an ample cupboard there,</div>
<div class="line">Where tin supplanted chinaware.</div>
<div class="line">A frying pan, which from a nail</div>
<div class="line">Suspended, dripped a greasy trail.</div>
<div class="line">Framed from the hemlock's poles and boughs,</div>
<div class="line">The rustic bunks within the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></div>
<div class="line">Were not elaborate affairs;</div>
<div class="line">While boxes filled the place of chairs.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Tacked on the unpretentious wall</div>
<div class="line">Were advertisements, great and small,</div>
<div class="line">While lithograph and crayon scenes,</div>
<div class="line">Clipped from the standard magazines,</div>
<div class="line">Comprised a mimic gallery,</div>
<div class="line">Which broke the wall's monotony.</div>
<div class="line">No carpets were upon that floor,</div>
<div class="line">But at the bottom of the door</div>
<div class="line">The rug, against its yawning crack,</div>
<div class="line">Consisted of a gunny-sack.</div>
<div class="line">Nor was there lock upon that door,</div>
<div class="line">The guardian of sordid pelf;</div>
<div class="line">The traveller, distressed and sore,</div>
<div class="line">Might enter there and help himself.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Within this weather-beaten hut</div>
<div class="line">Of logs, by many a tempest tried,</div>
<div class="line">With doors and windows closely shut,</div>
<div class="line">To keep the genial warmth inside;</div>
<div class="line">A group of hardy mountaineers,</div>
<div class="line">Blockaded by the winter's snow,</div>
<div class="line">Sat by the fireside's ruddy glow.</div>
<div class="line">Some old, and old beyond their years,</div>
<div class="line">As disappointments, toil and strife,</div>
<div class="line">Which constitute the miner's life,</div>
<div class="line">Must operate with process sure,</div>
<div class="line">Toward age, unduly premature;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></div>
<div class="line">For years, in stern privation spent,</div>
<div class="line">Are traced in seam and lineament,</div>
<div class="line">Which gives the patriarchal face</div>
<div class="line">Its rugged dignity and grace.</div>

<h3>II. A CHAPTER FROM AN OLD MAN'S LIFE</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">As ample wreaths of curling smoke</div>
<div class="line">From his time-honored meerschaum broke,</div>
<div class="line">A kindly-faced, gray-bearded man</div>
<div class="line">Rose up and sadly thus began,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">"You ask a tale,&mdash;well, I'll express</div>
<div class="line">The reason why in manhood's prime</div>
<div class="line">I left a more congenial clime</div>
<div class="line">And sought this rugged wilderness."</div>
<div class="line">But, gentle reader, don't expect</div>
<div class="line">A tale in mongrel dialect,</div>
<div class="line">For "Uncle Jim," or James T. Hale,</div>
<div class="line">Who lived as anchorite or monk,</div>
<div class="line">Once led the senior class at Yale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></div>
<div class="line">And had his sheepskin in his trunk.</div>
<div class="line">There, while the crackling flames leaped high,</div>
<div class="line">And serpentine gyrations played</div>
<div class="line">Around the logs of hemlock, dry,</div>
<div class="line">And with the tempest seethed and swayed,</div>

<div class="line">Arrayed in nature's pristine dress</div>
<div class="line">This was indeed a wilderness.</div>

<div class="line">Confronted hardy pioneer.</div>

<div class="line">A story, with few incidents,</div>
<div class="line">But many years of penitence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></div>
<div class="line">As one, for some foul crime pursued,</div>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Of Russian Pete but little had been known,</div>

<div class="line">No more his close associates could tell,</div>

<div class="line">About this stranger with the clever tongue,</div>
<div class="line">An air of mystery and sadness clung.</div>
<div class="line">His name, so long and unpronounceable,</div>
<div class="line">Which none could frame, much less presume to spell,</div>
<div class="line">Waiving abridgment, partial or complete,</div>
<div class="line">Was, by the boys, transformed to "Russian Pete."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Now Russian Pete was tall and strong of limb,</div>
<div class="line">Nor more than half as old as Uncle Jim,</div>
<div class="line">Of noble stature and commanding brow,</div>
<div class="line">With knees which in no genuflections bow.</div>
<div class="line">His face was sad, the index of a breast</div>
<div class="line">Where memory's fires were raging unsuppressed.</div>
<div class="line">With eyes which search in closest scrutiny,</div>
<div class="line">Nor yet offend the object they would see.</div>
<div class="line">One, who from feature, act and equipoise,</div>
<div class="line">Had known life's sorrows better than its joys.</div>
<div class="line">A man whom you would notice in the street,</div>
<div class="line">And know the second time if you should meet.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">This man of mystery and intellect</div>
<div class="line">Arose, and stood in manhood's poise erect.</div>
<div class="line">In tone of voice so musical and clear</div>
<div class="line">It might have charmed the most exacting ear,</div>
<div class="line">And wealth of language few can hope to reach,</div>
<div class="line">Nor trace of foreign accent in his speech,</div>
<div class="line">He forthwith spake: "My simple tale shall be,</div>
<div class="line">Not one of love, but dire captivity.</div>
<div class="line">Like Uncle Jim's, however, it contains</div>
<div class="line">The cause why I forsook my native plains.</div>
<div class="line">No tender web of sentiment, but one</div>
<div class="line">By treachery and machination spun.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Across the sea, in distant realms afar,</div>
<div class="line">In the remote dominions of the Czar,</div>
<div class="line">Past where the Dnieper rolls his murky flood,</div>
<div class="line">Surcharged with fertilizing silt and mud,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></div>
<div class="line">Past the dark forests and productive plains,</div>
<div class="line">Which he with many a tributary drains;</div>
<div class="line">Within that city whose inhabitants,</div>
<div class="line">With flaming torch, withstood the arms of France,</div>
<div class="line">Preferring ruin to the victor's boast,</div>
<div class="line">Or occupation by an alien host.</div>
<div class="line">Fair Moscow, which became a funeral pyre,</div>
<div class="line">And perished in her self-ignited fire,</div>

<div class="line">A few years since, the date concerns us not,</div>
<div class="line">A minor detail readily forgot,</div>

<div class="line">There dwelt two students, children of one sire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">With prospects fair at manhood's budding edge,</div>
<div class="line">In caste esteemed of no base parentage;</div>
<div class="line">Two students, versed in languages, and planned</div>
<div class="line">For consul service in a distant land,</div>
<div class="line">As foreign usages are studied most,</div>
<div class="line">When one aspires to diplomatic post.</div>
<div class="line">Thus eagerly, did we acquire the tongue</div>
<div class="line">Of you, whom I address and live among.</div>
<div class="line">With lucubrations diligent, we sought</div>
<div class="line">Our ways up varied avenues of thought,</div>
<div class="line">Until by prejudice no longer bound,</div>
<div class="line">We stood at last upon dissenting ground;</div>
<div class="line">Or wavered, where reluctant doubts confuse,</div>
<div class="line">In that strange zone of ruminating views,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></div>
<div class="line">Where progress and established custom meet;</div>
<div class="line">Yes, crossed its boundaries with reckless feet.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">In that stern Empire, on disruption's brink,</div>
<div class="line">Some things you may,&mdash;and some you may not,&mdash;think;</div>
<div class="line">Express yourself, and instantly disgraced,</div>
<div class="line">Your steps may point toward a Siberian waste;</div>
<div class="line">Your substance confiscated by a court</div>
<div class="line">Where equity is but a theme for sport;</div>
<div class="line">Extol your theories, proffer your advice,</div>
<div class="line">And chains or banishment may be the price.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">For despot hands, since might's initial sway,</div>
<div class="line">Have fashioned chains for worthier hands than they;</div>
<div class="line">And oftentimes beneath the tyrant's heel</div>
<div class="line">Are crushed the lives which strive for human weal;</div>
<div class="line">Who dare to hold the gonfalon aloft</div>
<div class="line">For human rights and progress, yes, how oft</div>
<div class="line">Since Cain that fratricidal murder wrought,</div>
<div class="line">Have death and durance been the price of thought!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">He who espouses radical reform</div>
<div class="line">Invites upon his head the gathering storm;</div>
<div class="line">Each forward step from Custom's hackneyed school,</div>
<div class="line">Draws forth the floods of scorn and ridicule;</div>
<div class="line">Witness the dungeon, guillotine and rack,</div>
<div class="line">Chains for the feet and scourges for the back;</div>
<div class="line">Bestrewn with insult, diatribe and cuff,</div>
<div class="line">The pathway of reform was ever rough;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></div>
<div class="line">And when reforms, as tidal waves have come,</div>
<div class="line">The foremost breakers dash to martyrdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Perhaps, in youth's enthusiastic heat</div>
<div class="line">We may have been a little indiscreet,</div>
<div class="line">When we, thus inexperienced and young,</div>
<div class="line">Against oppression dared to raise the tongue.</div>
<div class="line">Perhaps 'twere best to tarnish manhood's brow</div>
<div class="line">With servile adulation, and to bow</div>
<div class="line">With craven salaam and obeisance, down</div>
<div class="line">In sycophantic homage to a crown.</div>
<div class="line">What, though the diadem its blazon rears</div>
<div class="line">Above a population's groans and tears!</div>
<div class="line">What, though the paths of tyranny be strew'd</div>
<div class="line">With suspirations of the multitude!</div>
<div class="line">If one but bask within the regal smile,</div>
<div class="line">Why strive against injustice, fraud and guile?</div>
<div class="line">Or, why enlist the sympathetic pen,</div>
<div class="line">Though thrones may crush the liberties of men?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">One inadvertent hour, some chance remark</div>
<div class="line">Was misconstrued with application dark;</div>
<div class="line">For little is required as an excuse</div>
<div class="line">When private ends are furthered by abuse;</div>
<div class="line">Suspicion's tunes are played with greatest ease,</div>
<div class="line">When jealousy manipulates the keys.</div>
<div class="line">What followed, it were wearisome to tell,</div>
<div class="line">Save that we found ourselves within a cell,</div>
<div class="line">Charged with sedition and conspiracy,</div>
<div class="line">By those more likely to conspire than we.</div>

<div class="line">Between the men, so strangely joined at last.</div>
<div class="line">All that the congregated miners heard</div>

<div class="line">The coming conflict, while the brazen notes</div>

<div class="line">Received no salutation when we met.</div>
<div class="line">Fair ones, who used to smile, now looked askance,</div>

<div class="line">Though of a family rich and widely known,</div>
<div class="line">I stood in the community, alone,</div>
<div class="line">Like a pariah none would recognize,</div>
<div class="line">Inaction was enough to ostracize.</div>
